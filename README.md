## FAQ

> What's the server IP?

The IP is `prisonbutbad.minehut.gg`.

> The plugin is disabling on server start, why is this?

There can be multiple reasons, but the most likely case is that you haven't created teams yet.
Run the following commands to solve this:
- `/team add Prisoners`
- `/team add Criminals`
- `/team add Warden`

> How can I configure prisons?

Currently, there is no owner friendly way to configure prisons. You will have to go into the code and change it yourself.
