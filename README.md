[Verse 1]
I told you secrets that I thought that you could keep
I'll give you anything, just show me what you need
I stare at my ceiling, yeah, it's hard for me to breathe
You drag me under, baby, take me underneath
I don't really want to cope with the hurt anymore
It's 4 A.M., and dead friends walk around in the morgue
I don't even know who the fuck I am anymore
Angels protect me, I've been callin' out to the Lord

[Chorus]
Think it's easy for me, they believin' in me
And the way that you talk is deceiving to mе
I wake up in the mornin', feel like I'm important
My world, yеs, it's stormin', so thanks for the warnin'
[Verse 2]
I've been thinkin' that I'm stupid 'cause I thought that I could trust her
You be talkin' in your groupchat, boy, I'm not your little brother
Tryna put on for my sister, and my father, and my mother
People showin' they true colors, they been hidin' undercover
I spend my time speakin' to the sky
The time that I realize this isn't home
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, baby, I know that you got it
Yeah, I'm not my old self, but I'm happy that I lost him
Yet it's time that I lost it, put a nail in my coffin
I'm thankful for Alexis and everything you taught him

[Chorus]
Think it's easy for me, they believin' in me
And the way that you talk is deceiving to me
I wake up in the mornin', feel like I'm important
My world, yes, it's stormin', so thanks for the warnin'
Think it's easy for me, they believin' in me
And the way that you talk is deceiving to me
I wake up in the mornin', feel like I'm important
My world, yes, it's stormin', so thanks for the warnin'
